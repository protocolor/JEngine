# JEngine

Nothing special to see here by now. This will be a space where my C-coded JEngine will be placed.

JEngine will be a light-weight game engine based on C targeting any hardware architecture by implementing all functions in software.
The goal is to create a retro game engine which follows 16 bit console game styles. 

JEngine will provide interfaces to the "outside" world, which then need to be wrapped according to the target system.

This is a pure fun project in order to learn how games and effects of that time were created.
